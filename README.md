# Polaris-API-PHP-Class
IUG Hackathon 2016 - My Lists Builder

This project was built by Mark W. Jarrell from Richland Library and Brian LaRue
from the Salt Lake City Library as part of the IUG 2016 Hackathon and uses
the Polaris 5.0 SP3 APIs to create lists for library customers. All methods
included in the API (add, copy, delete, etc.) are used in the project except for
"copy all items" and "move item" simply because we ran out of time.

## Installation
1. Download the Polaris API PHP Class from https://github.com/RCPL/Polaris-API-PHP-Class.
2. Add that code to a directory within the "hackathon" directory called "Polaris-API-PHP-Class".
3. Read the README.md included with that code and follow the setup/installation instructions.
4. That's it! You can now begin using the code on your LAMP server.
